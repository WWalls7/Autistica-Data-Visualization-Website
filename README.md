# Data Visualization Application for Autistica

This is a web application designed to display quiz results to autistic users in an easy to understand way, using positive reinforcement tactics to ensure user happiness.

# Implementation

The application was made at JPMorgan's Code for Good Hackathon in 2019 by a team of myself (Wendy Walls) and 4 others using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Sample quiz results were parsed from a CSV file.

# Description

Users log into the application and view results from quizzes they have taken, displayed using various charts
